# My Personal Project

## What will the application do

This program is a local multiplayer game, supporting two to four players to play.
Players are placed in a two-dimensional map and each player is assigned a color. 
They color the map by moving around the map or using props.
After a certain amount of time, the game will settle the final color area as the final score for each player.

## Who will use it

Everyone is welcome to play the game.

## Why is this project interest to you

I've been thinking about how to design some fun party games 
that anyone can play at the party and enjoy the games.
This will promote friendship, unless they are overly concerned about winning or losing the game.
